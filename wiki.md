In the mid-1800s, Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii to work on plantations brought with them *kakigori*, which grew in popularity. The immigrants would use their tools to get shaved ice from large blocks of ice and then adding sugar or fruit juice, which is easily absorbed by the ice due to it being finely shaved like powder. Fresh, local fruits such as coconut, papaya, or passionfruit are used as toppings or fuit syrups/juice; ice cream is usually added at the core; and adzuki beans are a common topping.
